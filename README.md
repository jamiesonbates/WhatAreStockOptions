## What is stock?
Stock itself is a pretty simple idea. To have stock in a company means that you own a percentage of the company. If the company has value, then you own some of that value. 

The most common example of stock is in the stock market. Stock (or shares) are traded on stock exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ, for example. Some one buys stock that someone else is selling and stock are exchanged for cash, in most cases. This type of stock is publicly traded and stock markets make buying or selling very easy.

Another example of stock is privately held stock. This is stock where there is no public market to buy and sell your ownership of a company. This might happen if you start a company and give out shares to investors who give you money to build your company in exchange for some ownership of the company, for example.

Employees of companies can benefit from recieving stock and can recieve both public or private stock. The terms are really up to the company.

## What are options?
Options are closely related to stock, because essentially, an option is the right but not the obligation to buy or sell stock. In cases where employees are offered options, they will most likely be offered the right to buy stock at a pre-determined "strike price." 

What does this mean? Well, if you were offered an option to buy 10,000 shares at $0.25 cents you would be able to purchase 10,000 shares at $0.25 per share for a grand total of $2500. That doesn't sound like a very good deal, especially if the stock was traded in a public market already. 

The importance of an option lies with the fact that your "strike price" does not change as the stock gains or loses value. If you are given options at the start of your tenure with a company, you stay with the company for 2 years, and during that time the company grows in value, then you can buy shares in the company by executing your options and immediately sell for a profit.

For example, if you were given the option to buy 10,000 shares at $0.25 cents and the company grew to $1.00 per share, you could buy 10,000 shares for $2,500 and immediately sell the shares for $1, grossing a profit of $7,500.

This is assuming you have the ability to convert your options and sell them as you please. More on this later.

## Why do companies issue stock or options?
There are a multitude of reasons for why companies choose to issue stock or options as part of a compensation package. The two most important and relevant are:
1. To retain employees
2. Lower costs

Lets dig into these two briefly. When hiring, employers hope that new employees stay with the company as long as possible. This is because hiring and training are costly and in general, lower turnover will lead to a stronger company. To retain employees, companies may use stock and options as compensation to entice employees to stay longer. In a simple example, employees who stay longer recieve more stock each year. More commonly, however, employees are given stocks or options as compensation with the requirement of vesting, which tightly links compensation to tenure. More on this later.

Companies may also use this type of compensation to lower their payroll costs. Since the cash from stock and options does not come directly from the company, they achieve lower payroll costs while theoretically paying the employee a competitive market rate.

## What is stock?
Stock itself is a pretty simple idea. To have stock in a company means that you own a percentage of the company. If the company has value, then you own some of that value. 

The most common example of stock is in the stock market. Stock (or shares) are traded on stock exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ, for example. Some one buys stock that someone else is selling and stock are exchanged for cash, in most cases. This type of stock is publicly traded and stock markets make buying or selling very easy.

Another example of stock is privately held stock. This is stock where there is no public market to buy and sell your ownership of a company. This might happen if you start a company and give out shares to investors who give you money to build your company in exchange for some ownership of the company, for example.

Employees of companies can benefit from recieving stock and can recieve both public or private stock. The terms are really up to the company.

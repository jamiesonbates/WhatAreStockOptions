## What is stock?
Stock itself is a pretty simple idea. To have stock in a company means that you own a percentage of the company. If the company has value, then you own some of that value.

The most common example of stock is in the stock market. Stock (or shares) are traded on stock exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ, for example. Some one buys stock that someone else is selling and stock are exchanged for cash, in most cases. This type of stock is publicly traded and stock markets make buying or selling very easy.

Another example of stock is privately held stock. This is stock where there is no public market to buy and sell your ownership of a company. This might happen if you start a company and give out shares to investors who give you money to build your company in exchange for some ownership of the company, for example.

## What are options?
Options are closely related to stock, because essentially, an option is the right but not the obligation to buy or sell stock. In cases where employees are offered options, they will most likely be offered the right to buy stock at a pre-determined "strike price."

What does this mean? Well, if you were offered an option to buy 10,000 shares at $0.25 cents you would be able to purchase 10,000 shares at $0.25 per share for a grand total of $2500. That doesn't sound like a very good deal, especially if the stock was traded in a public market already.

The importance of an option lies with the fact that your "strike price" does not change as the stock gains or loses value. If you are given options at the start of your tenure with a company, you stay with the company for 2 years, and during that time the company grows in value, then you can buy shares in the company by executing your options and immediately sell for a profit.

For example, if you were given the option to buy 10,000 shares at $0.25 cents and the company grew to $1.00 per share, you could buy 10,000 shares for $2,500 and immediately sell the shares for $1, grossing a profit of $7,500.

This is assuming you have the ability to convert your options and sell them as you please. More on this later.

## Why do companies issue stock or options?
There are a multitude of reasons for why companies choose to issue stock or options as part of a compensation package. The two most important and relevant are:
1. To retain employees
2. Lower costs

Lets dig into these two briefly. When hiring, employers hope that new employees stay with the company as long as possible. This is because hiring and training are costly and in general, lower turnover will lead to a stronger company. To retain employees, companies may use stock and options as compensation to entice employees to stay longer. In a simple example, employees who stay longer recieve more stock each year. More commonly, however, employees are given stocks or options as compensation with the requirement of vesting, which tightly links compensation to tenure. More on this later.

Companies may also use this type of compensation to lower their payroll costs. Since the cash from stock and options does not come directly from the company, they achieve lower payroll costs while theoretically paying the employee a competitive market rate.

## What is vesting?
Companies might employ a retention strategy called vesting. Essentially, employees are given stock or options as part of their compensation package, but will only be able to capitalize on their stocks and options after a period of time.

For example, say you are given $10,000 in stock that has vesting terms of 4-year vest with a 1-year cliff vest. This means that you will be able to access 25% or $2,500 dollars of the stock after 1 year, with the rest vesting on a rolling (i.e. monthly) basis. So after 13 months, you will have access to $2,708 of your stock or (25% + 1/36).

There are many rules for vesting, but what you need to know is that if you receive an offer for stock or options as part of your compensation package, you need to ask what the vesting terms are.

## What is liquidity?
Before now, we have been (mostly) ignoring one crucial part to the equation of accepting stock or options as compensation. The bottom line for any offer that includes this type of compensation is, knowing how you convert it to cash.

For example, employees of Amazon typically receive stock after 2 years of working at Amazon. On offer, lets say they will receive $30,000 of stock after 2 years at Amazon. This means they have a 2 year vesting period. Lets also assume that this employee leaves the day after their stock vests. Luckily for this employee, Amazon is a publicly traded company and the employee can sell their stock immediately and collect the proceeds.

Liquidity refers to the ability to convert a non-cash asset, like stocks or options, to cash. In the case of stocks and options as compensation, in order to capitalize on your stock or option package, you need a place to sell it. Do your research on a company to determine whether such a market exists. If none exists, you will be speculating on the future of the company.

## Why are vesting and liquidity barriers to converting stock or options into cash?

Vesting rules may require that a tenure exceed a certain period of time before you are compensated in stock or options. Liquidity refers to your ability to convert non-cash assets into cash.

### Things to consider: vesting
* If you aren't ready to commit to a company for the vesting period, much of your compensation could be worthless if you leave before the period ends.
* Especially for your first job, you may be able to make up the difference between lost compensation from leaving a company before you're fully vested, by simply getting a better job and offer at a new company (your job experience is valuable).
* Time value of money: if you don't receive a large portion of your compensation until down the line, does this differ from a situation where you received this compensation as part of your salary.

### Things to consider: liquidity
* If there is no market where you can convert your stock or options into cash, you need to consider IF there is any value to them. This pertains directly to the company offering you stocks and options. Are you willing to risk it?
* If there is a market, liquidity isn't a concern.
